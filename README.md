In 2023, I graduated with a BSc degree in computer science from the University of Warsaw. Currently, I am pursuing a BSc degree in mathematics.

My interests mainly encompass algorithmics, graph theory, and high performance computing. I enjoy coming up with elegant solutions, and finally understanding something
I couldn't for a long time always brings me a lot of satisfaction and motivates to keeping it up. :) At the moment, I'm focusing on spectral graph theory.

My hobbies include linguistics, photography, and all kinds of sport. I'm an avid reader and whenever I have a bit of free time, I escape to the pile of books
that has only been growing for some time now.
